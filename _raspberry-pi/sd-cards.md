title: SD Cards

Model B had an SD card slot. Model B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 moved to a Micro SD card.

Suggestion is to use sizes 32GB or less, as the standards say that SD cards of size more than 32GB should be formatted as exFAT. This scheme is not supported by the Raspberry Pi and hence won't boot [(http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=83220&p=588601#p588601)](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=83220&p=588601#p588601)

SD card speeds are split into categories. When prefixed with class the number relates to MB/s e.g. class 3 is slower than class 5. Higher speeds have dropped the class prefix and are known as UHS - [https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/](https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/)

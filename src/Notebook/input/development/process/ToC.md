It't Not Luck - Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Focuses on higher level more strategic thinking.  Avoid conflicts by challenging assumtions.  Should not be a need to comprimise to find solutions, there should always be a win-win answer.  Introduces thought processes of a evaporating cloud, current reality tree and future reality tree - essentially logical steps written out clearly.  The book provides worked examples but think I would benefit from having the concepts of these models explained first before reading the book again 

## Critical Chain

Critical Chain - Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Theory of constraints applied to project management.  Critical path and critical chain should be the focus of project management attention with buffers put in place between paths that interact with these to absorb any slippage.  Safety should be removed from all estimates to improve thorughput and avoid common pitfalls

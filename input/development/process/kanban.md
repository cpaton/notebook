Kanaban - Successful evolutionary change for your technology business
(David J Anderson)

* Chapter 1 - ToC Drum-Buffer-Rope is an alternative implementation of a pull system.  Kanban seems to have a better fit to software development
* Chapter 2 - Kanban 5 core properties
    * Visualise workflow
    * Limit work in progress
    * Measure and manage flow
    * Make process policies specific
    * Use models to recognise improvement opportunities
* Chapter 3 - steps for implementing kanban within an existing team without causing too much disruption
    1. Focus on quality - fixing defects is the biggest source of waste in software development
    2. Reduce work in progress - studies so direct link between wip and quality
    3. Deliver often - build trust between development and other teams
    4. Balance demand with throughput - only accept new work when work is complete.  Exposes the bottleneck and creates slack enabaling time for improvement
    5. Priotize - look to maximize business value and not just development team throughput
    6. Attack sources of variability to improve predictability - more advanced topic and should be tackled after the above 5

**Pricing**

How can you assume an option is not risky when working out its price?

You can replicate the option by owning stock in the right proportion to options you can remove risk.

Say you have a portfolio of

* One share bought at £100
* Sold two options giving the right to buy @ £100 one month in the future

How much should the option premium be?

Say within a month the share price will be worth either £110 or £90 - either is equally likely

* Price is £110
* * Need to provide two shares as option is exercised.  You buy in market @ £110 and sell for £100 - down £20
* * The stock you own has increased £10
* * Net effect lost £10
* Price is £90
* * Options not excercised
* * Stock you has decreased in value £10
* * Net effect lost £10

In both cases your portfolio has decreasd in value by £10.  So the option premium should be £5 each to compenate

This demonstrates that by having the right mix of options and stock you are risk free.

This is a simplified example.  Within the month the price of the stock will change, so to be fully hedged the portfolio mix needs to be constantly adjusted.  But it shows that the underlying stock returns are not important to the option price.  Its the volatility that is important - i.e. what the stock price will likely be on excercise date
